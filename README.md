# ipaddress
First "major" C program I ever wrote. Will be adding some changes to it, as it isn't really good right now, in my opinion, and it is just a learning experience for me.

A very simple program that gets your private and public IP addresses.

It can fetch your private or public IP address, denoted by the arguments you give it. It will automatically obtain your public IP Address, if not told to obtain the latter.


Configuration is done by editing the config.h file, and, then, recompiling the program. Very simple.
